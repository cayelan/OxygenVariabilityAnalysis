# OxygenVariabilityAnalysis
This analysis on changing variability in dissolved oxygen dynamics in lakes and reservoirs supports the Kilham Lecture manuscript submitted by C.C. Carey to Inland Waters on "Causes and consequences of changing oxygen availability in lakes."

In this repository, please find the DataAnalysis.R script, which downloads Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) repository data by Stetler et al. (2021) on lake and reservoir dissolved oxygen time series. The DataAnalysis.R script analyzes the oxygen time series and generates all figures in the manuscript (included here).
